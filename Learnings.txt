NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (NLP)
=================================

Natural Language Processing is an interdisciplinary field of 
Artificial Intelligence. It is a technique used to teach a 
computer to understand Human languages and also interpret 
just like us. It is the art of extracting information, hidden
insights from unstructured text. It is a sophisticated field
that makes computers process text data on a large scale.

Applications of NLP:
=====================

Natural Language Processing is powering many industries with 
its advanced Deep Learning Algorithms like transformers, 
language models(GPT-3), RNNs, LSTMs, and many more.

NLP is used in,

*    Sentimental Analysis
*    Chatbots
*    Virtual Assistants
*    Speech Recognition
*    Machine Translation
*    Advertise Matching
*    Information Extraction
*    Grammatical error detection
*    Fake news detection
*    Text Summarize

 Libraries for NLP
====================

Here are some of the libraries for 
leveraging the power of Natural Language Processing.

    Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
    spaCY
    Gensim
    Standford CoreNLP
    TextBlob

Installation
=============
    pip install nltk

SEABORN
========

Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. 
It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas 
data structures.

Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data. Its plotting 
functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole
datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping 
and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots.
Its dataset-oriented, declarative API lets you focus on what 
the different elements of your plots mean, rather than on the
details of how to draw them.
